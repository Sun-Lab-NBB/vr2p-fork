) -> np.ndarray:
    """Calculate rolling average movement speed in centimeters per second (cm/s) from a DataFrame.

    The DataFrame must contain either:
      1. Columns named "x", "y", "z", "time", or
      2. Columns named "position", "path", "time".

    If "x", "y", and "z" are present, the function automatically calculates
    the distance in 3D space for each frame and assigns them to a temporary
    path "test". Otherwise, if "path" is present, it processes each path independently.

    Teleport artifacts or extremely large movements beyond the specified threshold
    are set to zero before rolling computation. The rolling window is indexed by the
    time column, which must be a pandas DateTime-like column.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing the requisite columns ("x", "y", "z", "time",
            or "position", "path", "time").
        window_size (int, optional): The size of the rolling average window in milliseconds.
            Defaults to 100.
        ignore_threshold (float, optional): Distance threshold, above which the movement is
            assumed to be a teleport artifact and is set to zero. Defaults to 20.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A 1D NumPy array of speed values (in cm/s) aligned with the input DataFrame.

    Raises:
        KeyError: If the required columns ("time" and either "path" or "x", "y", "z") are missing
            from the DataFrame.

    Notes:
        - Speed calculation is performed by computing the distance traveled between consecutive
          frames, then taking the rolling mean of these distances over the specified time window.
